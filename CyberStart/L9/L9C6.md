Agent, those Spetzners are really trying to test our patience! We have someone on the inside that managed to quickly take a copy of one of the gang's hard drives. But just to make it really hard to figure out what they're doing they've removed all file extensions - from every file!

We know there's a Jpeg in there somewhere with an image of the particular EMP they're trying to steal, but it's taking the team forever to find it. Can you think of a quicker way?

SSH sessions only last 60 minutes, after that you will need to reload the page to get a new one.

**Time Left:** 57 minutes

These are the details you'll need:

**Username:** ECeUtw1YUq

**Password:** cOxWd7JKgI

**IP Address:** 63.32.105.197

**Port:** 16897

**Tip:** Find the Jpeg, it contains a serial number (SN), that's the flag!
