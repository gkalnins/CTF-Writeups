One of the Spetzners lives in Tayga, a heavily forested area with a lot of bears! So it's no surprise that he spends some of his spare time taking photographs of them and posting them to a nature site called медведь следить (which is Russian for "Bear Watch"). We thought it was fairly innocent until one of the agents spotted something weird about one of the images.

Take a look at them and see if you can spot what it is.

**Tip:** There's a hidden file, open it to get the flag.
