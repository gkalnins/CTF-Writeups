# L9C9

Agent, we have SSH access to one of the gang's servers that contains lots of files and we need to find one in particular.

One of the gang, Stanislav, created the file on 22 Nov 2015 at 8.00pm (we know because we were monitoring him!). Can you find that particular file, we think it contains important information concerning the whereabouts of several gang members.

SSH sessions only last 60 minutes, after that you will need to reload the page to get a new one.

**Time Left:** 58 minutes

These are the details you'll need:

**Username:** 5gT6nkXOmG

**Password:** jShnz0mQdO

**IP Address:** 63.32.105.197

**Port:** 26513

**Tip:** Find the file, it contains the flag.
