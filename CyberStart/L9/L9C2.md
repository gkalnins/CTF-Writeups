Agent, quick task for you if you have a few minutes to spare. We have an old program one of our previous agents used that we can't get into. Can you get into it for me?

**Tip:** Run the program, find the password, input it into the program to get the flag.

Agent, you may want to look into using a tool called 'Strings', it's built into most Linux systems. Learn more by typing `man strings` in your terminal window.
