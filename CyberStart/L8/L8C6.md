Recruit, it's time for you to get back in the field. We want to do a test run of one of the ship's onboard security systems. Take a look at the online control panel to the ship's security. Can you find a way to turn the alarms off? If you can, then maybe The Chiquitoos' can too!

By the way, our intel tells us that there used to actually be a button called "Turn Off Alarms", which the ship's security team removed to try and make it more secure. Maybe start with that.

**Tip:**Â Turn off the alarms to get the flag.

There's a secret button called "Turn Off Alarms" which has been removed, but you should be able to turn off the alarm anyway. Try pressing the other buttons and see what the URL shows, then see if you can perform the hidden action.
