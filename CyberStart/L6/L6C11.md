# L6C11

Were you involved in the previous level when we needed someone to SSH into one of the Yakoottees' servers and take a look around? Well, we need to do it again. It seems they're becoming a little smarter about hiding their files. Take a look and see what you can find.

SSH sessions only last 60 minutes, after that you will need to reload the page to get a new one.

**Time Left:** 59 minutes

These are the details you'll need:

**Username:** FXbWNRtvNF

**Password:** 67bu8ggSa5

**IP Address:** 63.32.105.197

**Port:** 27393

**Tip:** The flag is in a file somewhere on the server.

hint: directory hidden in plain sight

### Writeup begins here:

ssh -p 27393 -v FXbWNRtvNF@63.32.105.197

did cat ./…/camouflage

returned with “goneIn404Seconds”

was the flag.
