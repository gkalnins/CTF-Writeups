# **Junya Who?**

Recruit, I need a favour. We've just had some intel about one of the gang members. His first name is Junya, but we can't find his surname. We know we have it on record, but it could be in any one of a huge set of files. Perhaps you could SSH into our server and see if you can find his surname for me?

SSH sessions only last 60 minutes, after that you will need to reload the page to get a new one.

**Time Left:** 59 minutes

These are the details you'll need:

**Username:** JMXUIWesZU

**Password:** iaKD1Dnaf3

**IP Address:** 3.253.22.18

**Port:** 27332

**Tip:** Find "Junya" mentioned in the files and his surname will follow. That's the flag.
