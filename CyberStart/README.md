<h1 align="left">CyberStart America 2024</h1>
<br /><br />
In this folder you will find a collection of estranged writeups from my junior year of highschool, in which I participated in CyberStart America's final year of operation. <br />

<br />This was not only my *first* time completing CTFs, but also using VMs & Linux **at all!**<br />

As such, the writeups contained in this folder are very... *lackluster,* and some may even be incomplete (oops).<br />

Originally, these were created in a private notion page, and have all been converted over to this repo, with "Writeup begins here:" after each challenge's prompt.

I thought that it was important to include these somewhere, as it serves as a reminder of where I started, and shows me just how much I've learned since!
