<h1 align="left">CyberStart America 2024</h1>
<br /><br />
In this folder you will find a collection of estranged writeups from my junior year of highschool, in which I participated in CyberStart America's final year of operation. <br />

<br />This was my *first* time not only completing CTFs, but also using VMs & Linux **at all!**<br />

As such, the writeups contained in this folder are very... *lackluster,* and some may even be incomplete.<br />

I thought that I should include these somewhere, as it serves as a reminder of where I started, and shows me just how much I've learned since!
